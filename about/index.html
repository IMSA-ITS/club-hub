**Changes to the Club Hub RemindMe! Service:**

+New CSS to match the main website's aesthetic.

                                             </pre></p>
                                             <h1>Project Information</h1>
                                             <img id="project-img" src="/clubhub/media/ClubHub_Logo.png" alt="Club Hub" align="left"/>
                                             <p><i>This is the project information page for Club Hub. For the website, go <a href=/clubhub>here</a>.</i></p>
                                             <p>As informative as it is, Students-l is widely regarded as spammy and annoying. At the same time, it's rather difficult to keep up IMSA Virtual Campus. Indeed, scrolling through an endless torrent of emails every day in addition to having to dedicate time to sort through a facebook page can be exhausting. With similar problems in a host of other channels, the result is a heavily fragmented communications scene on campus--it can be very difficult to get a clear idea of what's going on at IMSA.<br /><br />
Club Hub seeks to fix this by providing a location where you can visually grasp the order of events at IMSA. The idea is that if we use posters as "icons" for each event and arrange them in an intuitive way, it'll be easy to literally see what's happening at the academy. Thus our vision: to make it easy to see What the Next Big Thing at IMSA is.</p>
                                             <h2>News</h2>
                                             <ul>
                                                  <li><b>9/7/2015 -- Club Hub v2.0.0 released!</b> This update features an entirely new layout, fresh CSS styling, and streamlined sorting and filtering features.</li>
                                                  <li><b>1/28/2015 -- Club Hub v0.3.0 beta is here!</b> We've got new organizational views, support for wide posters, reminders, and more!<br /><br />
                                             </ul>
                                             Club Hub is ready to be used regularly by everyone on campus. However, there is always room for improvement! While the website is very stable, design features and layout details are subject to change. Feedback is important! Please let us know how we're doing through the feedback link at the bottom of the Club Hub site.</li></ul>
                                             <h2>The Vision</h2>
                                             <p>Club Hub is website that aims to make it easy to find out exactly what's up at IMSA in one swift glance. It seeks to complement the existing forms of communication--especially the mailing list and facebook page--by proving a resource that organizes communications beautifully in one place. In the end, Club Hub will help students answer the question, "What's the Next Big Thing at IMSA?"
                                             The current sub-goals focus on the current minimum viable product provided by Club Hub: the poster wall. These goals are to 1) encourage the use of nice and clean posters as visual cues to the events/ideas/movements/etc. they represent; 2) provide organizational tools to students in order to help them better understand what the latest thing at IMSA is; and 3) streamline club and campus communications by consolidating the information all into one format at one accessible place.<br /><br />
                                             As of early September 2015, Club Hub has reached a version of 2.0.0. Featuring a table that visually organizes information about events in a sortable and filterable layout, it is making significant progress towards fulfilling its original vision.
                                             After Club Hub achieves widespread adoption, it will be time to move on to further future visions. Some ideas being considered at the present include
                                             <ul><li>Individual, easily managed club pages for each club that can be organized as to provide overview information,</li>
                                             <li>A dynamic, customizable calendar of events, and</li>
                                             <li>A poster slide-show feature for presentations and advertisement boards.</li></ul>
                                             These updates are slated for the near future, but only site popularity will determine if they can be implemented or not. But if one thing's for sure, it's now easier than ever to know What the Next Big Thing at IMSA is.</p>
